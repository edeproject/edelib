\section Behind

Well, this is a short answer why edelib is what looks like, and why some
things are probably different than you used to see.

There are a few goals behind it, and I am hoping they are/will-be
satisfied:

   * lightweight
   * portable
   * usefull
   * not-bloated
   * exception-less
