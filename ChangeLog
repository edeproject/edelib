	* Work on Window class; now it is by default double buffered, inheriting
	Fl_Double_Window, but can be switched to Fl_Window too
	* Fixed bug in DirWatchInotify where continuous events would not be
	reported (two directories are watched, file is moved from one to second
	watched directory)
	* Added create_window_xid() which do the same job as Fl_X::make_xid() but
	with function parameter where can be done work before window is mapped
	* icon() is now known as window_icon() so to not collide with default
	icon() member from Fl_Window
	* Let ALLFLAGS contains FLTKFLAGS (in Jamconfig.in) so jam can pick up
	correctly X11 paths

2007-11-29  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added checks for daylight variable; FreeBSD does not have it (presumably
	other BSD's). Is this glibc extension ?
	* Cleared some old code from Window.cpp
	* Let SoundSystem be correctly compiled when sounds are disabled

2007-11-28  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Implemented icon() in Window which will correctly set an titlebar icon
	with transparency. Also added libxpm.m4 for libXpm checks since icon()
	use it.

2007-11-26  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Let jam distclean remove .jamcache and .jamhcache files
	* Versioning is done in single place in configure.in
	* Fixed issue in inotify DirWatch when file is moved in/out watched
	directory so DirWatch can report DW_REPORT_CREATE/DW_REPORT_DELETE
	correctly

2007-11-25  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added mime.m4 which should check presence of XDG MIME database
	* DirWatchFam.cpp added with FAM/Gamin implementation
	* DirWatchInotify.cpp returns true if directory already registered, the
	same behaviour as for DirWatchFam.cpp
	* Removed DW_DNOTIFY from DirWatch header and dirwatch.cpp example
	* Removed DirWatchDnotify.cpp file
	* One less entry in TODO
	* DirWatchGeneric.cpp will return true for every function, so it can be
	used in code without interruption, althought will do nothing ;-)
	* Removed dnotify checks in notify.m4
	* Made DirWatch be compiled when FLTK is present since it depends on
	FLTK's descriptor watching code
	* Handle FAMAcknowledge event too
	* Removed obsolete comment from IconTheme
	* Removed obsolete commented code from Directory.cpp

2007-11-23  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Updated docs for DirWatch class
	* Added DirWatchInotify.cpp DirWatchGeneric.cpp and moved old dnotify code
	in DirWatchDnotify.cpp. Now desired backend will be choosen during compile
	time. As dummy fallback will be used DirWatchGeneric which will do
	nothing. dnotify is still not merged into new code and fam/kqueue are
	pending for implementation

2007-11-19  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Replaced dnotify.m4 with notify.m4 where are (now) performed checks for
	inotify, dnotify and FAM presence
	* Replaced EDE_ with EDELIB_ in *.m4 and configure.in files
	* kqueue checks added in notify.m4

	* New settings property in Window class and fixed small color issues

2007-10-25  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	(on initial startup) keep serials to zero which is compatible with
	XSETTINGS referent implementation
	* The same done for XSettingsClient
	* Window class added

2007-10-24  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Documented XSettingsClient

2007-10-23  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Detail tests for DesktopFile file class including above addition
	* Removed few finished entries from TODO

2007-09-17  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sound.m4, disable checks for mad library
	* Uh... finally fixed odd bug in MessageBox caused due non-resizable group 
	where readqueue() would miss any event produced by child that was laying
	outside group bounds (the odd thing was for childs that was partially
	laying outsid group; part of the child inside group bounds would report
	event, but part of the same child outside those bounds would not ;P)

2007-09-16  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* In SoundSystem init() driver can be given
	* init() will return some status

	* In MimeType added subclass_of() to check mime parents
	* In DesktopFile try_exec(), strncpy known stuff ;)

2007-09-03  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Hopefully better scanning in DirWatch. Still sucks, but less than
	previous version

2007-09-02  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Sound can be run in non-blocking mode via additional thread. Not fully 
	tested.
	* One line less in TODO ;)

	* ask()/message()/etc. are modal
	* Added fd.o icon names in MessageBox

	compatibility

2007-08-28  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added clear parameter to dir_list()
	* Fixed a bug in Config; multiple load() calls would _append_ data, not

	* Added MessageBox class
	* Added inited() to IconTheme and SoundSystem

	via xdg_mime_find_data(). MimeType changed to reflect this
	* Added efile as sample
	* GetOS added to Jamrules

2007-08-18  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

2007-08-15  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* user_config_dir(), user_data_dir() and user_cache_dir() will, as
	fallback, return value peeking inside $HOME env, as required from
	freedesktop.org. Previous version was using '~/' directly which can cause 
	problems with functions that don't understaind shell shortcuts. Now, if 
	dir_home() fails, it will then use '~/'.

	* util.cpp, removed tests for fallbacks in above directories since those
	depends on HOME

2007-08-13  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

2007-08-8  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Explicit disable List(const List&) and operator=(const List&)
	* IconChooser uses list now
	* DirWatch uses list too; since list have private copy ctor, found that
	some parts of DirWatch would call it anyway (DirWatchEntry), unneededly copying 
	container data; fixed with allocation on heap
	* dir_list now uses list instead vector

2007-07-30  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added const size() in List
	* Added operator bool() in List too

	section/key does (can't find any reason why would someone use
	unlimited sections/keys !)
	* Small fixup with clear() in Config class
	* Added tests for config_getline() functions, used internally by Config
	class
	* Finished remove_entry() in Config
	* Fixed strncpy issue when requested size in Config's get() is less than
	actuall since strncpy() does not terminate string
