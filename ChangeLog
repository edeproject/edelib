	object
	* TODO entry
	* Better matching interface for signals and method in EdbusConnection,
	hopefully

2008-07-29  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added test/perf/stringtok.ss as comparison against chicken scheme

	* Fixed assertion check in is_double() in EdbusData
	* Fixed remove_all() in EdbusList
	* Test for dbus code. Not completed....

2008-03-25  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added strsplit.{h,cpp} as comparison with stringtok()

2008-03-04  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added findfile.m4, pkg.m4 and dbus.m4 macros. Mostly for D-BUS
	detection. D-BUS will be first detected via pkg-config; if pkg-config does
	not exists, configure will manually scan known places for headers and
	libraries
	* Removed dir_remove_rec(). Hoping some day I will add better code.
	* Replaced DIR_SEPARATOR and DIR_SEPARATOR_STR with E_DIR_SEPARATOR and
	E_DIR_SEPARATOR_STR all over the code 
	* Added dir_create_with_parents() with the tests

2008-02-26  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Completed Time class with removal of millisecond member
	* In tests/util.cpp, before environmet vars are changed, they are saved
	first and later restored. That also caused removal of warning message

	* Documented Time class
	* Added system_set() in Time class

	* Added E_RETURN_IF_FAIL and E_RETURN_VAL_IF_FAIL macros
	* Little reformatting in xdgmime.h
	* Fixed issue with update_settings() in Window.cpp; when client calls this
	with receiver uid, receiver will get event even if client immediately
	hides itself. Previously this wasn't the case.
	* Added double_buffer() member in Window
	* Revised Window documentation and cleaned unused code in Window.cpp

2008-02-23  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Efatal (and the rest) is changed to _edelib_fatal() and similar

2008-02-17  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added edelib_strlcat() with tests

2008-02-16  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added missing.cpp in test suite so it can test various functions form
	Missing.{h,cpp}
	* Added edelib_strlcpy() with tests

2008-02-11  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* In Config.cpp made static functions that are visible only inside
	this file
	* In Jamrules removed EXEMODE from installation; jam by default set it to
	711

2008-02-10  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added replace(char, char) in String with tests

2008-02-01  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Improved font chooser both in dialog and font scanning. Dialog contains
	'styles' for regular/bold/italic/... and font scanning will try to group
	fonts into families. It is not perfect since can miss some fonts,
	especailly when there are a huge number of fonts, yielding that regular
	points to bold face or similar, but I don't know can it be better due bad
	FLTK font list engine
	* Added small test for font chooser

2008-01-20  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* First changelog entry in 2008 !!! ;)

	versions will not correctly resolve 'regmatch_t __pmatch[__restrict_arr]'
	construct

2007-12-07  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* Removed check for awk
	* Removed check for kqueue

2007-12-06  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Use LocalDepends and LocalClean in Jamrules
	* Let mime_type be NULL when new node was created in xdgmimeglob.c. This
	should assure we don't get odd crashes in xdgmime
	* Generating README gives more problems than it solves it (especially for
	platforms without gawk by default) so genreadme and index.dox are removed
	and README and INSTALL are added
	* Removed unused files from docs too

2007-12-05  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Better compilation of test suite when edelib was compiled without X11
	and FLTK support
	* Fixed uninitialized variable valgrind detected in Window class
	* jam install now finaly works as should be

	variable is externaly declared
	* Rewrote dir_list so it does not use scandir() any more due portability
	* Also fixed bug where previous dir_list() didn't show '.' and '..'
	directories
	* Replaced dir_separator() with DIR_SEPARATOR and DIR_SEPARATOR_STR

2007-11-30  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Work on Window class; now it is by default double buffered, inheriting
	Fl_Double_Window, but can be switched to Fl_Window too
	* Fixed bug in DirWatchInotify where continuous events would not be
	reported (two directories are watched, file is moved from one to second
	watched directory)
	* Added create_window_xid() which do the same job as Fl_X::make_xid() but
	with function parameter where can be done work before window is mapped
	* icon() is now known as window_icon() so to not collide with default
	icon() member from Fl_Window
	* Let ALLFLAGS contains FLTKFLAGS (in Jamconfig.in) so jam can pick up
	correctly X11 paths
	* Added FontChooser dialog

2007-11-29  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added checks for daylight variable; FreeBSD does not have it (presumably
	other BSD's). Is this glibc extension ?
	* Cleared some old code from Window.cpp
	* Let SoundSystem be correctly compiled when sounds are disabled

2007-11-28  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Implemented icon() in Window which will correctly set an titlebar icon
	with transparency. Also added libxpm.m4 for libXpm checks since icon()
	use it.

	* Let jam distclean remove .jamcache and .jamhcache files
	* Versioning is done in single place in configure.in
	* Fixed issue in inotify DirWatch when file is moved in/out watched
	directory so DirWatch can report DW_REPORT_CREATE/DW_REPORT_DELETE
	correctly

2007-11-25  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added mime.m4 which should check presence of XDG MIME database
	* DirWatchFam.cpp added with FAM/Gamin implementation
	* DirWatchInotify.cpp returns true if directory already registered, the
	same behaviour as for DirWatchFam.cpp
	* Removed DW_DNOTIFY from DirWatch header and dirwatch.cpp example
	* Removed DirWatchDnotify.cpp file
	* One less entry in TODO
	* DirWatchGeneric.cpp will return true for every function, so it can be
	used in code without interruption, althought will do nothing ;-)
	* Removed dnotify checks in notify.m4
	* Made DirWatch be compiled when FLTK is present since it depends on
	FLTK's descriptor watching code

	* Removed obsolete comment from IconTheme
	* Removed obsolete commented code from Directory.cpp

2007-11-23  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Updated docs for DirWatch class
	* Added DirWatchInotify.cpp DirWatchGeneric.cpp and moved old dnotify code
	in DirWatchDnotify.cpp. Now desired backend will be choosen during compile
	time. As dummy fallback will be used DirWatchGeneric which will do
	nothing. dnotify is still not merged into new code and fam/kqueue are
	pending for implementation

2007-11-19  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Replaced dnotify.m4 with notify.m4 where are (now) performed checks for
	inotify, dnotify and FAM presence

	* New settings property in Window class and fixed small color issues

2007-10-25  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	(on initial startup) keep serials to zero which is compatible with
	XSETTINGS referent implementation

2007-09-17  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sound.m4, disable checks for mad library
	* Uh... finally fixed odd bug in MessageBox caused due non-resizable group 
	where readqueue() would miss any event produced by child that was laying
	outside group bounds (the odd thing was for childs that was partially
	laying outsid group; part of the child inside group bounds would report
	event, but part of the same child outside those bounds would not ;P)

2007-09-16  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* In SoundSystem init() driver can be given
	* init() will return some status

	* In MimeType added subclass_of() to check mime parents
	* In DesktopFile try_exec(), strncpy known stuff ;)

2007-09-03  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Hopefully better scanning in DirWatch. Still sucks, but less than
	previous version

2007-09-02  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Sound can be run in non-blocking mode via additional thread. Not fully 
	tested.

	* ask()/message()/etc. are modal
	* Added fd.o icon names in MessageBox
	* run() and run_plain() in MessageBox accepts flag for dialog centering
	* Removed that silly List to list define; now list is used for STL
	compatibility

2007-08-28  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added clear parameter to dir_list()
	* Fixed a bug in Config; multiple load() calls would _append_ data, not
	clear previous one. Now it will do opposite. Uh...

	* Added MessageBox class
	* Added inited() to IconTheme and SoundSystem

	via xdg_mime_find_data(). MimeType changed to reflect this
	* Added efile as sample
	* GetOS added to Jamrules

2007-08-18  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added Regex class with tests

2007-08-15  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* user_config_dir(), user_data_dir() and user_cache_dir() will, as
	fallback, return value peeking inside $HOME env, as required from
	freedesktop.org. Previous version was using '~/' directly which can cause 
	problems with functions that don't understaind shell shortcuts. Now, if 
	dir_home() fails, it will then use '~/'.

	* util.cpp, removed tests for fallbacks in above directories since those
	depends on HOME

2007-08-13  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

2007-08-8  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Explicit disable List(const List&) and operator=(const List&)
	* IconChooser uses list now
	* DirWatch uses list too; since list have private copy ctor, found that
	some parts of DirWatch would call it anyway (DirWatchEntry), unneededly copying 
	container data; fixed with allocation on heap
	* dir_list now uses list instead vector

2007-07-30  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added const size() in List
	* Added operator bool() in List too
	* Dumped non-const size() and empty() from List

	section/key does (can't find any reason why would someone use
	unlimited sections/keys !)
	* Small fixup with clear() in Config class
	* Added tests for config_getline() functions, used internally by Config
	class
	* Finished remove_entry() in Config
	* Fixed strncpy issue when requested size in Config's get() is less than
	actuall since strncpy() does not terminate string
	* Sizes for get() are unsigned int now

2007-07-16  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Forced environ outside edelib namespace
	* Added tests for Vedran's String fix

	* Correct paths for jam cached data

2007-07-11  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Newer autoconf versions require datarootdir to be present.
	Jamconfig.in and initjamfile.m4 are modified for that

2007-07-07  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	generate wrong code and redirect to set(...,...,bool) member. Uh!

2007-05-25  Sanel <karijes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added few ESTRLOC to IconTheme
	* Values returned from splitted Inherits key (IconTheme) are
	trimmed which will prevent wrong path construction
