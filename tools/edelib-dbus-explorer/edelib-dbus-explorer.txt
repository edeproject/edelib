Introduction
============

edelib-dbus-explorer is handy tool for exploring, inspecting and calling DBus
services, their methods, signals and properties. Before you start using it, make
sure to familiarize yourself with DBus (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus)
at least on basic level.

To start using it, first connect to either session or service bus. To do so, from
the menu choose File -> Connect To -> (Session Bus | Service Bus), and you will be shown
with all available services on given connection. After selecting service, you will
get service objects and interfaces with methods.

Editor and laguage basics
=========================

The text you are reading now is in so called 'script editor'. This is place where you can
write and evaluate scheme code; simply pointing cursor to open or closed parenthesis, you
will get highlighted evaluate-able region. Pressing SHIFT-Enter will evaluate it and print
result if the function have printable method. To evaluate and print any value, you can use ALT-Enter

To see it in action, select below example and press ALT-Enter:

 (: 1 + 2)

or maybe:

 (println "Hello world")

you will see results immediately.

Many of scheme functions are self-documentable, so to here is example how to use it (as above
examples, just select it and evaluate it):

 (doc 'println)
