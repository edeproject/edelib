TODO list:
----------
 * seems File::readline() does not return 1 when line contains only '\n' char. Should return ?
 * error checks during stream read/write in File (ferror)
 * add File::read()
 * correct File::write(const char* w, int s) -> File::write(const char* w)
 * in Config, don't allow [] sections
 * add convinient Time class
 * maybe better SharedLibraryFromObjects in Jamrules
