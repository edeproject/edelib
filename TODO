TODO list:
----------
 * seems File::readline() does not return 1 when line contains only '\n' char. Should return ?
 * error checks during stream read/write in File (ferror)
 * in Config, don't allow [] sections
 * what should set_textdomain_dir() and set_textdomain() return when NLS is disabled ?
 * documentation install strangely depends on xxx/doc/edelib-xxx/html directory; how ?
 * add local snprintf/vsnprintf/scandir/dirent(???)
 * Date can accept set(0,1,0); leave this or... (possible bugs ?)
 * xdgmime calls too much xdg_mime_init()/xdg_mime_shutdown(); move these in MimeType class
 * MimeType; add locale during read of comments
 * What Config as localized keys should read: LC_MESSAGES or LANG ??? I'm using for now LANG,
   but fd.o people said it should be LC_MESSAGES. Inspect this.
 * Remove register_object()/unregister_object() from EdbusConnection ?
