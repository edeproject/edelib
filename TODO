TODO list:
----------
 * seems File::readline() does not return 1 when line contains only '\n' char. Should return ?
 * error checks during stream read/write in File (ferror)
 * correct File::write(const char* w, int s) -> File::write(const char* w)
 * in Config, don't allow [] sections
 * Config::remove_entry() finish
 * XDG functions in Util.h needs more checking
 * what should set_textdomain_dir() and set_textdomain() return when NLS is disabled ?
 * organize documentation into modules
 * Sound should have explicit option for setting various drivers
 * non-blocking Sound
 * NULL is on FreeBSD defined differently; check this
 * documentation install strangely depends on xxx/doc/edelib-xxx/html directory; how ?
 * more checks on GenDocumentation since /usr/bin/env gawk -f does not work
 * dir_list() should expand directory to current when "." is added only
 * add local snprintf/vsnprintf/scandir/dirent(???)
 * IconTheme will probably fail if Directories contains spaces between ',' delimiters; trim this
 * Date can accept set(0,1,0); leave this or... (possible bugs ?)
