TODO
====
 * seems File::readline() does not return 1 when line contains only '\n' char. Should return ?
 * error checks during stream read/write in File (ferror)
 * in Config, don't allow [] sections
 * what should set_textdomain_dir() and set_textdomain() return when NLS is disabled ?
 * add local snprintf/vsnprintf/scandir/dirent(???)
 * Date can accept set(0,1,0); leave this or... (possible bugs ?)
 * xdgmime calls too much xdg_mime_init()/xdg_mime_shutdown(); move these in MimeType class
 * MimeType; add locale during read of comments
 * What Config as localized keys should read: LC_MESSAGES or LANG ??? I'm using for now LANG,
   but fd.o people said it should be LC_MESSAGES. Inspect this.
 * Remove register_object()/unregister_object() from EdbusConnection ?
 * Last change in xdgmime.c moved stat-ed code to be executed first so ambiguous directory names
   (like ".kde" or ".emacs.d" or ".e") doesn't be recognized as files or unknown types; can stat's
   be delayed
 * Check IconTheme/XSettings code in edelib::Window: IconTheme will be initialized twice when
   XSETTINGS manager is running in the background. The first time will be with "edeneu" theme and
   after window is shown, theme would be changed to whatever XSETTINGS manager is keeping.
   edelib::Window::init() should probably use icon theme name frome XSETTINGS manager firstly.
